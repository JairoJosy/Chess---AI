# Chess---AI

## Chess Game with AI and Multiplayer Options

This is a chess game with AI and multiplayer options. It is built using Python and the Pygame library. The game supports both single-player mode against an AI opponent and multiplayer mode for two human players. The AI opponent uses the minimax algorithm to determine the best move

## Installation

To run the game, you'll need to have Python 3 and Pygame installed. If you don't have Pygame, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

Once you have Python and Pygame installed, clone this repository and navigate to the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JairoJosy/Chess---AI.git
cd Chess---AI
```

## Usage

To start the game, run the app.py file:
```bash
python app.py
```

You will see a menu with two options: "Single Player" and "Multiplayer". Choose the mode you want to play.

## AI Mode (Single Player Mode)

If you choose "Single Player" mode, you will play against an AI opponent. The AI uses the minimax algorithm to determine the best move.

## Multiplayer Mode

If you choose "Multiplayer" mode, you will play against another human player. The game supports two-player mode on a single computer. Players take turns moving pieces by clicking on them and then clicking on the square they want to move to.
